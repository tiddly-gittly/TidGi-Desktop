##### Where can I download previous versions of Singlebox?
Even though previous versions of Singlebox are no longer officially supported, you can still download them from [here](https://github.com/atomery/singlebox/releases).

##### Does Singlebox support Amazon Music, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, Netflix and Spotify?
Yes, it does, but only with non-Electron browser engines. We would love to support these apps with Electron. But they rely on a technology call [WidevineDRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widevine) which is not available for Electron because of technical and legal constraints [\[1\]](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/testing-widevine-cdm) [\[2\]](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/03/googles_widevine_drm/).

##### Is Singlebox open source?
Yes, you can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/atomery/singlebox) under the MPL-2 license.

##### How long will my Singlebox trial last?
The trial has no time limit but only lets you install up to 2 apps (with up to 2 workspaces per app).

##### How long does my Singlebox license last?
Your license is valid perpetually. It has no time limit, never expires and works with all versions (including major updates).

##### Can I install Singlebox on multiple computers?

##### Do you offer refunds?
Yes, we offer a full refund within 30 days of your purchase.

##### I lost my license key. How can I retrieve it?
