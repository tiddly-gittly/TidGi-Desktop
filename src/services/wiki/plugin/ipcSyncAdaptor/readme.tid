!! SyncAdaptor

Copied and modified from Tiddlywiki core's `plugins/tiddlywiki/tiddlyweb/tiddlywebadaptor.js`.

It uses `src/services/wiki/ipcServerRoutes.ts` exposed from `window.wiki.ipcServerRoutes` to communicate with the main process.

Some `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` logic are removed, because we don't need this process when doing IPC. And some tiddlyweb related logic are removed, because it seems just transform to/back from tiddlyweb format, and nothing really changes after data received.
